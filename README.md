# Password-Generator
In this challenge I will create a random password generator that uses different characters 

# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description 

This week’s challenge requires us to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. 

## Table of Contents 

Additionally to the usual information, I am including the list of comments from my JS that I used to make it more accessible:

JS CODE:
* Array of special alphanumerical and symbols characters
* Function for getting a random element from an array
* Function to generate password with user input
* Conditions for password generation
* Write password to the #password input

TABLE OF CONTENTS:
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.e

## Usage 

a random password generator is used to create strong and secure passwords for various purposes, such as:

Protecting Accounts: Generates complex passwords to secure online accounts, making them more resistant to hacking attempts.

Enhancing Security: Creates passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, making it harder for others to guess or crack them.

Preventing Unauthorized Access: Adds an extra layer of protection to personal information on devices and online services by using strong, unpredictable passwords.

Compliance: Helps meet security standards and regulatory requirements that mandate the use of robust passwords for sensitive information.

Managing Multiple Accounts: Generates unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of security breaches if one password is compromised.

Integration with Password Managers: Works seamlessly with password management tools to simplify the process of creating and storing secure passwords.

Automating Systems: Useful in automated systems, scripts, and applications where passwords need to be generated dynamically for user authentication.

Temporary Access: Creates passwords for temporary or guest access, which can be changed or invalidated after a specific period.

Discouraging Credential Sharing: Discourages sharing of passwords, as randomly generated passwords are harder to remember and less likely to be written down.

Overall, a random password generator is a tool that helps make passwords more robust, protecting information and accounts from unauthorized access.
